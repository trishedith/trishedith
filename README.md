## O! Hi there ^__^

Lately I have been focusing on learning Javascript primarily, but also a little CSS and HTML too. 

I'm currently working on my pre-course work for Codesmith's Software Engineering immersive program.  

I am always looking to collaborate on projects.  I hope to one day make open-source software that is as useful for others as the ones I have used from others.

I have a background in Fine Arts / Studio Arts.  Ask me about any artsy thing, I love discuss aesthics and design.

The best way to reach me is thru e-mail.  ( trishedith @ gmail.com )

I use she/her and they/them pronouns.

When I'm not coding I'm probably biking, swimming and drawing :)
